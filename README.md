# PersonalSite

This is my personal portfolio site, built before makers to learn web development. it is deployed and can be viewed [here](https://dkeen0123.github.io/PersonalSite/).

### To run locally

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/DKeen0123/PersonalSite
npm install
gulp watch
```

I use gulp to manage development, and so any changes can be made in the app folder and will be updated on localhost 3000, provided you are running gulp watch.

I create a production build with Gulp and Webpack, using `gulp build`.

### Challenges and to-do's

As the site was built before my Makers Academy course, Some best practices, such as testing, were not followed. The site is also inefficient and has slow load times. This is something I am looking at optimising by rebuilding it in ReactJS.
